# Pocket Teacher

## Description
This was a desktop app programmed for the 2020 Purdue EcoMake hackathon.  It's main purpose is to help supply education to less fortunate areas.  The app, in basic terms, is a video player that can support areas with sparse wifi connection.  The functionality of the app relies on electron's online/offline detection.  If the user is online it will give them the options to download different videos created on the platform.  If the user is offline it will give them the option to watch any videos they have downloaded.
